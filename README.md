## Tips for a Stellar Submission

- **Time Management:**  
  With a tight 3-day window, schdule your work so you can thoughtfully work through each assignment.

- **Document Your Thought Process:**  
  Your approach and reasoning are as significant as your final answers. Clear, well-explained submissions will stand out. One way to achieve this would be to provide a document with your thinking process (This file should be written by you coz we want to know how well you can think not an LLM ;)

- **Stay Engaged:**  
  Keep in touch with the community on the WhatsApp group. Interacting with fellow candidates can spark new insights and help clarify doubts.
