# Project Scenario: RoboCup Preparation for Team Prometheus

**Objective:**  
Prepare and deliver a fully integrated prototype for the upcoming RoboCup humanoid competition in the kid's League.

Below are sample project tasks provided in a non-sequential order. Use your project planning skills to reorder them, assign realistic start and end dates, and identify dependencies among tasks.

---

### Project Tasks

1. **Electrical Systems Setup**

   - **Duration:** 4 days
   - **Details:** Design and prepare the electrical subsystem.
   - **Dependencies:** None explicitly mentioned; can begin after initial requirements are set.

2. **Prototype Assembly**

   - **Duration:** 7 days
   - **Details:** Physically assemble the initial prototype by integrating mechanical parts and electrical components.
   - **Dependencies:** Must await completion of both Mechanical Design Drafts and Electrical Systems Setup.

3. **Final Integration and Validation**

   - **Duration:** 4 days
   - **Details:** Combine all subsystems, perform a comprehensive integration, and validate the final design before the competition.
   - **Dependencies:** Requires completion of Testing and Debugging, as well as Sponsor Outreach and Marketing Preparation.

4. **Requirements Definition Meeting**

   - **Duration:** 1 day
   - **Details:** Gather all project stakeholders to define overall project requirements, scope, and initial scheduling.
   - **Dependencies:** None. This is the kickoff meeting.

5. **Mechanical Design Drafts**

   - **Duration:** 5 days
   - **Details:** Develop preliminary mechanical designs for the robot, considering functionality and mobility.
   - **Dependencies:** Should follow the Requirements Definition Meeting.

6. **Software System Architecture Planning**

   - **Duration:** 3 days
   - **Details:** Plan the software aspects including control systems, ball detection algorithms, and overall system architecture.
   - **Dependencies:** Begins after the Requirements Definition Meeting.

7. **Testing and Debugging**

   - **Duration:** 5 days
   - **Details:** Once the prototype is assembled, conduct rigorous testing of the integrated systems and debug any issues found.
   - **Dependencies:** Depends on both prototype assembly and the completion of the Software System Architecture Planning.

8. **Sponsor Outreach and Marketing Preparation**

   - **Duration:** 3 days
   - **Details:** Prepare outreach materials, schedule meetings with potential sponsors, and lay the groundwork for a marketing campaign.
   - **Dependencies:** Can be planned concurrently with other tasks but should ideally provide input before final integration.

9. **Review and Documentation**
   - **Duration:** 2 days
   - **Details:** Compile project documentation, review all tasks, and prepare a final report for submission.
   - **Dependencies:** This task wraps up the project and should follow Final Integration and Validation.

---

### Additional Milestones

- **Milestone 1: Prototype Finalization**

  - **Trigger:** Completion of Prototype Assembly.
  - **Significance:** Ensures that the assembled prototype is ready for further testing.

- **Milestone 2: Project Readiness Review**
  - **Trigger:** After Final Integration and Validation, along with successful Sponsor Outreach.
  - **Significance:** A final review stage to confirm that the project meets all necessary criteria before the competition.

### Your Task

1. **Reorder & Plan:**  
   Analyze the provided tasks, identify their dependencies, and determine a realistic timeline.
2. **Gantt Chart Creation:**  
   Use your software of choice (e.g., GanttProject, EdrawMax Online, or Microsoft Excel) to create a Gantt chart that includes:

   - Task names
   - Start and end dates
   - Durations
   - Dependencies
   - Key milestones

3. **Submission:**  
   Export your final Gantt chart as an **.xlsx** file. If needed, include brief documentation (either embedded within the Excel file or as an additional Markdown document) outlining your reasoning and methodology.

**Note:**  
We value your approach and planning strategy as much as the final timeline. Demonstrate your ability to manage complex information, establish a clear plan out of a jumbled set of tasks, and articulate your process efficiently.

Good luck! We look forward to seeing how you tackle this project planning challenge as part of our management recruitment process for Team Prometheus.
