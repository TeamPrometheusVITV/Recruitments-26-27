# Mechanical Recruitment Task 2025-26

## Introduction to Mechanical Design and Assembly

### Learning Objectives:

- Understand the basics of 3D part modeling and assembly.
- Gain hands-on experience with CAD software.
- Learn to interpret and replicate engineering drawings.

---

## Prerequisite Software:

1. *CAD Software (Fusion 360/SolidWorks/Autodesk Inventor):*

   - Ensure you have a CAD software installed for part modeling and assembly.
   - If you don’t have access to licensed software, Fusion 360 offers a free version for students.

2. *Engineering Drawings:*

   - You will be provided with a set of engineering drawings to replicate.
   - Download the drawing files from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YmzX0CpCGwb5VX5jUs5bLmZ9ZWYl4oAw?usp=drive_link).

## Task 1: Part Modeling

### Objective:

- Model the provided parts accurately in your CAD software.
- Follow the given dimensions and tolerances.

### Instructions:

1. Open your CAD software and create a new part file.
2. Refer to the provided drawings and start modeling each component.
3. Ensure correct units and dimensions are used.
4. Save your part files in .STEP and .SLDPRT/.F3D formats.

### Submission:

- Upload your part files to the designated submission folder.
- Ensure all parts are named correctly as per the drawing file.

## Task 2: Assembly Modeling and Analysis

### Objective:

- Assemble the modeled parts using appropriate constraints.
- Ensure the mechanism functions as intended.
- Perform a basic motion study on the assembly.(Bonus)

### Instructions:

1. Open a new assembly file in your CAD software.
2. Import all the modeled parts.
3. Use constraints (mates, joints, etc.) to assemble them correctly.
4. Validate the movement and alignment of the assembly and perform a simple motion study.

### Submission:

- Upload the final assembly file in .STEP and native format (.SLDASM/.F3D).
- Provide screenshots of the fully assembled model laong with a video of the motion analysis.
